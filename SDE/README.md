# ATLAS readme:
## Work in Progress!

This repository is an implementation of the ATLAS algorithm from Crosskey and
Maggioni's paper [ATLAS: A Geometric Approach to Learning High-Dimensional
Stochastic Systems Near Manifolds](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/140970951).

## Getting Started

The codes are all written in MATLAB, and running the code requires downloading
the src directory.

<!--These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.-->
The main files to run the code are:

atlas_driver.m - choose from parameters, set up examples from paper
construction.m - construct the ATLAS for the given example,
